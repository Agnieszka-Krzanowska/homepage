# HOMEPAGE - Agnieszka Krzanowska
## DEMO: https://agnieszka-krzanowska.github.io/homepage/

This is the first webside I've created using the "YouCode" course.
This page presents a short description about me, for example: what my hobbies are, what I like to do with my free time and my favourites books.

Here is a **GIF** to demonstrate how my website look
